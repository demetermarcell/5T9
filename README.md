# 5T9

## Project Description:
5T9 is an interactive decoding game that puts your T9 texting skills to the test. 
Players must decode as many messages as possible within 5 minutes, translating number sequences into readable text using the classic T9 mobile input system.
The game’s aesthetic draws heavy inspiration from the iconic Nokia 3310, evoking a wave of nostalgia for those who grew up in the late '90s and early 2000s. With its retro pixel-style interface, 5T9 offers a fun and challenging experience that blends old-school mobile tech with a modern gaming twist. Whether you're reliving the golden era of texting or discovering T9 for the first time, this game is a perfect mix of memory, speed, and logic.

- Header: The logo features a pixelated, code-inspired design, perfectly setting the tone for the game’s retro-tech theme.
- Main: The app design is inspired from the Nokia 3310 cellphone. Fonts, color palette, favicon, screen layouts and buttons are designed around this concept.
